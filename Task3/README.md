Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  + Give a short narrative on what each function is doing, how does it do what it do.
  + Write out the final model equation and interpret the coefficients. 
  + Overall, just need to add more narrative throughout the notebook. 
  + I like how you briefly state what each module is for and divide the notebook into different sections by steps.
