Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  + plot_hist function: You might need to investigate your if, else statement. I think it should come before your plot statement... Or, it might not be needed at all.
  + I think it'd be helpful to also show Benzene concentration across a combinition of different time frames (e.g. group by season and month).
  + Is there a categorical variables summary?
  + Overall, I think you did a great job giving background information, explaining each step as you go, and interpreting results. I like how you also provided comments in your code chunks that explains what each line's doing. The way you structured the notebook is clear as well. The overall summary at the end was also a great way to conclude the explanatory data analysis. Good job!
